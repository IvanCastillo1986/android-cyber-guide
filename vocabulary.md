# Vocabulary

## flash memory
* a type of of non-volatile computer memory (unlike RAM which loses data when power is removed) that can be erased and reprogrammed with electrical signals. This means it retains data even when the power is turned off, making it ideal for permanent or long-term storage in a wide range of devices. It typically erases data in blocks rather than individual bytes, and has a finite number of write/erase cycles until it wears out. It's solid-state, since it has no moving parts (unlike HDDs), making it more durable, quiet, and resistant to shock/vibrations. <br>
* It works by storing information in an array of memory cells, each made from a **floating-gate transistor**. These transistors can trap electrons, and the presence or absence of these trapped electrons determine whether a memory cell stores a binary "0" or "1". 
* it has faster read/write speeds compared to HDDs, leading to quicker boot times, faster application launches, and overall improved system performance.
* flash memory is ubiquitous in modern electronics in modern electronics due to above stated benefits: 
    - USB flash drives - portable storage
    - SSDs - replaces traditional HDD in computers
    - Memory Cards - digital cameras, smartphones, tablets, SD cards, etc.
    - Embedded Systems - IoT devices, routers, even BIOS chips in computers for storing firmware.
    - Gaming consoles - game data, system updates, user profiles.
* the two main types of memory are:
    - NAND Flash - optimized for high-density data storage and fast write speeds. Commonly found in SSDs, USB drives, memory cards. 
    - NOR Flash - known for direct random access capabilities. Suitable for executing code directly, such as in embedded systems for boot code and firmware. 

## boot ROM
* a critical piece of firmware embedded directly into a computer system CPU or a dedicated chip. It's the first set of instructions executed by the processor immediately after power-on or a reset.
