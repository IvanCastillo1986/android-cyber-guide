# CMOS
aka Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor<br>

This is a type of integrated circuit design, and its by far the most widely used in computing. It uses both **NMOS (N-channel [MOSFET](/electronics/MOSFET.md))** and **PMOS (P-channel [MOSFET](/electronics/MOSFET.md))** transistors in a complementary arrangement to create logic gates and other digital circuits.
