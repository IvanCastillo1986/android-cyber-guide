# SPI
Serial Peripheral Interface  -  a data transfer interface that connects directly to hardware. 

Flash Memory  -  a type of non-volatile computer storage that retains user data, even after system shut down. 

EEPROM  -  a ROM whose contents can be erased and reprogrammed using pulsed voltage, and can access individual bytes. 

SPI Flash Memory  -  a type of EEPROM flash memory. It's non-volatility allows the data to persist. 

The master device sends clock signal and data requests to the slave device, and the slave device responds with the data it requested. 

It's the prime standard for synchronous serial communication. Integrated systems in embedded systems use them for short distance wired communnication.

SCLK (Serial Clock)
SS (Slave Select)
MISO (Master Slave Input)
MOSI (Master Slave Out)
