# CPU
aka **Central Processing Unit**

Before we dive into the Android CPU, let's talk about what **chips** are.

# Chips
aka **Integrated Circuits (ICs)**

Chips are essentially a way of modularizing circuits. That is, delegating just one segment of your full computer's circuits to accomplish a task. 

Examples of chips accomplishing different tasks are:<br>
**Microprocessor chip** performs calculations and controls.
**Memory chip** stores data.
**Amplifier chip** boosts signal strength.
**Voltage Regulator chip** provides a stable power supply. 

Each of the listed chips encapsulates a complex circuit into a single, manageable component. If an issue is diagnosed (the computer turns off unexpectedly), a technician might think to look into troubleshooting near the chip that handles that task (the Voltage Regulator chip).

Old circuits were built using discrete components (large, standalone pieces like a diode or transistor) that had to be wired together manually. The **Integrated Circuit** solved this issue in the 1950's, revolutionizing electronics. Now, circuits that perform specific tasks would not need to be made from scratch. Instead engineers were able to select pre-made circuits and connect them together, like Lego blocks, which reduced complexity and cost. This modularity also allowed for abstraction in larger systems.
