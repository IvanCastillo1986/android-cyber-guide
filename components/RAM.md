# Random Access Memory
RAM is a type of memory that provides short-term data storage for direct access by the processor.

## What does it look like?
They are usually physically found as *memory modules* or *RAM sticks* plugged into your computer's motherboard. These are printed circuit boards (PCBs) designed to hold multiple Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) integrated circuits (ICs). 

Capacitor - an electrical component that stores energy in an electric field by accumulating electric charges on two conductive plates separated by a dielectric.

Dielectric - an insulating material placed between capacitor plates. It's crucial for increasing capacitance, enhancing breakdown voltage, and proper plate separation.

Printed Circuit Board (PCB) - aka Printed Wiring Board. A flat, rigid board made of nonconducive material that serves as the foundation for electronic devices. It uses conducive pathways (aka traces) etched on its surface. Usually colored green. 


## Path of Random Access
The "random access" allows the CPU to access any location in memory directly.

<!-- ToDo:  continue here. The path the data takes through the board -->
It begins with the CPU, which might need a piece of data to perform an operation. ww
